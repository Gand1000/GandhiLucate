            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>
                This is a full-stack Django web application that’s connected to a SQLite3 database. 
                Users are able to create, read, update, and delete flash on the web as you please.  
                The app is based on the Django framework,  <br/>
                it also uses HTML, CSS, Python, and SQLite to give structure, styling, functionality,
                and data storage capabilities to the web application.  <br/>

                The application is based off the Leitner system where flashcards are grouped together  
                base on how well that you know them. There are five boxes numbered one to five, with  
                one being the box that you know the least and five the most. Upon answering a question  
                correctly from one box that flashcard is moved to the next corresponding box.  If you  
                are not able to answer the question correctly it’s moved to the first box. To use this app to  
                it’s fullest you should put the most amount of energy towards the lowest number box while spacing  
                 out the learning over time. In doing these two things mention you will incorporate space  
                 repletion into your learning process, and in turn greatly increasing your  
                 retention of the material.
